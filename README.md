## Digital project laboratory Implementation of a termometer @ Chalmers University of technology

Outdoor and indoor temperature are read. The result is reported on an LCD display. One keystroke should be able to switch between outside and indoor temperature. In addition, it should be possible to see max and min temperature Max / min temperature must be reset.

DS18S20 is used for temperature reading. The result is shown on a display (DMC 16117A (Links to an external site.))

Variation: the outdoor temperature is transmitted wirelessly to the unit.

Difficulty 4, temperature circuit which does not give a sign of life until it is properly treated. However, once you understand the function of the circuits, the project is simple.
However, VHDL heavy! With option / variant 5+
